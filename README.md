# learn-file-storage-s3-golang-starter (Tubely)

This repo contains the starter code for the Tubely application - the #1 tool for engagement bait - for the "Learn File Servers and CDNs with S3 and CloudFront" [course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-file-servers-s3-cloudfront-golang) on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev)

## Quickstart

*This is to be used as a *reference\* in case you need it, you should follow the instructions in the course rather than trying to do everything here.

## 1. Install dependencies

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- `go mod download` to download all dependencies
- [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) - both `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are required to be in your `PATH`.

```bash
# linux
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# mac
brew update
brew install ffmpeg
```

- [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) only required for you to manually inspect the database.

```bash
# linux
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3

# mac
brew update
brew install sqlite3
```

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

## 2. Download sample images and videos

```bash
./samplesdownload.sh
# samples/ dir will be created
# with sample images and videos
```

## 3. Configure environment variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You'll need to update values in the `.env` file to match your configuration, but _you won't need to do anything here until the course tells you to_.

## 4. Run the server

```bash
go run .
```

- You should see a new database file `tubely.db` created in the root directory.
- You should see a new `assets` directory created in the root directory, this is where the images will be stored.
- You should see a link in your console to open the local web page.

# Conclusion

This app let's you create an account, authenticate you with JWTs (Json Web Tokens) and upload videos and thumbnails into a Sqlite database, with a title and a description for each video.

We use AWS S3 to create a private bucket, where we stored the videos.

To access these videos, we made a distribution on CloudFront.

We also use **ffmpeg** to set the **-movflags** to **faststart**, allowing the video to start playing before the entire file is downloaded, so whenever you request the video from the cloud, you will only get one response with code 206 (partial content) instead of three 206 responses with the same video but without the faststart feature.

One of the previous versions (see previous commits) used a set of signatures to create a temporary link to the private video, which was awful to implement but fun.
